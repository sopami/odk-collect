# shadows

Includes [custom Robolectric Shadows](https://robolectric.org/extending/) that it doesn't make sense to contribute back to Robolectric itself. An example would be for Shadows of classes in AndroidX libraries, some of which still have similarly untestable interfaces to their Android SDK counterparts.
